## Reproducing the data analysis


1. Download all the data reports from the "search" section of MassIVE [MSV000093494](https://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/dataset.jsp?task=ac44b779d8a04ca285a263616796c3b8).

2. Download the "AnalysisFromProtocol" folder from the [QuantQC](https://github.com/Andrew-Leduc/QuantQC) Github page. In the R script "Analysis.R", change the path names for the relevant meta data files. There are two types. The linker file which connects the file names from the MS runs to the wells of the plate they were run from, and the cellenONE cell sorting files. These files are origninally named XXX_isolated.xls and are auto generated by the cellenONE in the folder created when the user performs cell sorting to the glass slide.

3. Run the Analysis.R script line by line following the comments in the script.
